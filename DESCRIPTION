Description: Implements direction-preferring confidence intervals for location
    parameters under normal models. Provides marginal (unconditional) and
    conditional confidence intervals using three methods: direction preferring,
    modified Pratt, and shortest. The methods are based on acceptance region
    inversion and allow preferential inference in a specified direction while
    maintaining nominal coverage.
